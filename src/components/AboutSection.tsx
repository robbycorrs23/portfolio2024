      <p>
        I am a full stack developer with experience in PHP, Python, JavaScript,
        React, MYSQLI, HTML & CSS, and more. I love to code and learn new
        languages, frameworks, libraries, etc. I like to refer to myself as a
        swiss army knife of web development. In my current role I am exposed to
        dozens of technologies from wordpress plugins, to javascript frameworks
        like next.js, to ecommerce platforms like Shopify.
